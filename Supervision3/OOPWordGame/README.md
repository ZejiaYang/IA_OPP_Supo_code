OOPCompleteWordGame
=====================

## I implement several features:  
- Remove all selections made after the unselected letter.
- Calculate the score and display it.
- Display the current word which is being processed. 
- New Game Button to restart the game. Not only the score gets back to zero, the tile grid layout also changes.
- Single character is accepted as word, but players need to find longer word to increase score.
